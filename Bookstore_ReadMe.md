## Routing Structure

The app uses **React Router** for navigation. Here's a breakdown of the routing structure:

- **Home Page**:  
  The landing page where users can find an overview of the bookstore and navigate to other sections.

- **Stores Page**:  
  Displays a list of stores. Clicking on a store will show more details and the books available in that store.

- **Books Page** (Within Stores):  
  Shows the books available in a specific store, where users can browse through the list.

- **Authors Page**:  
  Displays a list of authors in a **tabbed layout**. Users can switch between different authors to view their information.

---

## Notes

- The project uses **static JSON files** inside the project, so no external server is needed.
- Data is imported directly into the components for simplicity.

---

## Future Improvements

- Implement **detailed pages** for each store and author.
- Add **form validations** and submission features using **Formik**.
- Enhance **UI/UX** with better design and animations.
